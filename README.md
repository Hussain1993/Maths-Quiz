This application is a simple program
aimed at small children that are still at primary school 
and need held with improving their maths skills. This application 
is a teaching aid that is supposed to be used with the help of the
teacher present to make sure that the pupil is using the tool correctly.

<p>
The teacher has the ability to creates their own profile in the 
application and then add all the pupils that are in their class; the
teacher also has the ability to the set the skill level of the 
pupil when they are creating a new pupil. This will then relay back into the
quiz where only questions that are related to that specific pupils skill level will
be chosen. This tailors the application to the pupils needs and requirements.</p>

<p>There is also a "Pupil Diary" incorporated into this application so the teacher
has an easy pace to find all the students such as their phone number and
address they will also be able to view if that specific pupil has any specific 
dietary needs that need to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>The teacher has the ability to change their username and password 
for the system. The system is also locked down, so a pupil can not access other
students personal information, the program also requires that the user enters a 
password when deleting records to ensure that there is no accidental deletion 
of records.</p>

<p>Once the pupil has taken the quiz their score will be logged onto the
system database, this is done each time a pupil successfully completes a quiz.
The teacher can then view these records and review the progress of the pupil
and then take the decision of choosing wether to move the pupils skill level
up or down. In this version there are currently two skills levels they are;
Easy and Hard. The teacher has the ability to print the records out if
needed by the school or department.
